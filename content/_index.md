# Welcome!

<h4 style="color:black"> This website was built completely with R (thanks <a href = "https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"> Blogdown! </a>) and HTML </h4>

My name is Brian Helsel and I'm a physical activity epidemiologist and an avid **#RStats** user. I am currently a postdoc with the Division of Physical Activity and Weight Management at the University of Kansas Medical Center. My family and I moved to Kansas City after I completed my PhD at Clemson University in 2020.
