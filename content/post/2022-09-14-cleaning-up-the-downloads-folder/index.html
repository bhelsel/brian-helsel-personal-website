<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Staying organized is a hard task! I often find myself trying new ways to
organize emails, documents, or information. One folder on my computer that I
often left untouched was my downloads folder. However, this weekend I decided to
create a function in R that could quickly sort document types that I wanted to
keep and remove document types that I didn’t want on my computer. For example, I
often download research articles in a PDF format that sometimes are not
immediately organized and remain in my downloads folder. They are then buried
under reference files (e.g., PubMed, EndNote), Word documents, etc. until I can
no longer find them quickly. Conversely, I’m not as interested in keeping file
types such as zip or EndNote, but I don’t generally delete them from my
downloads folder.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>I decided this weekend that I would write a function in R that would sort my
downloads folder by file type and remove any file types that I didn’t want to
keep. File types that I use and want to keep often (e.g., Word documents,
images, PDF documents, etc.) can be placed in <code>allowed_files</code> within the
function while all other file types will be removed. Additionally, the function
has an argument called <code>allowed_filetypes</code> that can be used to add file types to
the embedded <code>allowed_files</code> list. The function creates a folder for each
document type and then transfers the documents to their respective folder. The
function can be modified for your use by adding in or removing additional file
types within the function or even changing the directory so that this can be
applied to a different folder. The function as it is written below is on my <a
href = "https://github.com/bhelsel/bhelselR/blob/master/R/utilities.R"> GitHub
page</a> and can be installed via <code>devtools::install_github(bhelsel/bhelselR)</code>.</p>
