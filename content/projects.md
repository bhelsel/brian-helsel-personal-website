### Current Projects

1. **Estimating walking intensity in adults with Down syndrome using a portable accelerometer**
  + *Role*: Principal Investigator
  
  + *Funding*: Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) awarded to Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/MuqfCa20d0eAL1EjLNtJcw/project-details/10210460"> TL1TR002368 </a>)
  
  + *Project Summary*: This research aims to develop strategies for using portable accelerometers to evaluate ambulatory physical activity with adults who have Down syndrome. We will develop and compare activity intensity cut-points for walking using vertical axis counts, vector magnitude counts, and gravitational units for hip and wrist worn accelerometers.

2. **The Promotion of Physical Activity for the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome**

  + *Role*: Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Research Assistant
  
  + *Funding*: Funded by the National Institutes of Health (PI: Ptomey; <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Z7knvETl3ESOMeUqy9kO3Q/project-details/10144917"> R01AG063909 </a>)
  
  + *Project Summary*: This is an early-stage clinical trial in 80 non-demented adults with DS to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of remotely delivered group MVPA sessions to increase daily physical activity, relative to a usual care control, and to determine the impact of physical activity on the development of Alzheimer’s Disease.

### Past Projects

1. **Remote delivery of a yoga intervention to adolescents with autism spectrum disorder**

  + *Role*: Principal Investigator
  
  + *Funding*: Funded by the Health Resources & Services Administration through the Healthy Weight Research Network
  
  + *Project Summary*: Adolescents with autism are less likely to engage in regular physical activity due to physical challenges (e.g., poor motor control, impaired strength and balance). Yoga is highly adaptable to an individual's capabilities and can help adolescents with autism improve motor control, strength, balance, and flexibility. This study aims to assess the feasibility of an in-home, remote-based yoga intervention for adolescents with autism and measures the change in their foundational physical activity-related skills, MVPA, and quality of life.

2. **A dyadic approach for a remote physical activity intervention in adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and their caregivers.**

  + *Role*: Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Study Coordinator.
  
  + *Funding*: National Institute of Health (PI: Ptomey; <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Yj-MitQH60SkmUEnBIc0Ng/project-details/10198748"> R01AG061187 </a>)
  
  + *Project Summary*: Adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers have low levels of physical activity. Available evidence suggests that regular physical activity can improve mobility, performance of activities of daily living, general cognition, and balance in adults with Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a remotely-delivered, group-based physical activity program in increasing moderate physical activity in adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregiver.

3. **Individual and Family Based Approaches to Increase Physical Activity in Adolescents with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities**

  + *Role*: Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Research Assistant
  
  + *Funding*: Funded by the National Institutes of Health (PI: Ptomey; <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UmeKTIvWK0ap4e1zqm2TOQ/project-details/10172955"> R01HD094704 </a>)
  
  + *Project Summary*: This study will compare changes in objectively assessed MVPA in adolescents with IDD randomized to a single level intervention delivered to the adolescent only or a multi-level intervention delivered to both the adolescent and a parent.
