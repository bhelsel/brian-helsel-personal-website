# Welcome!

<img alt = 'Picture of my family' width='30%' src="/images/HelselFamily.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;"> 

My name is Brian Helsel and I'm a physical activity epidemiologist and an avid **#RStats** user. I am currently a postdoc with the Division of Physical Activity and Weight Management at the University of Kansas Medical Center. My family and I moved to Kansas City after I completed my PhD at Clemson University in 2020.

My plan is to use this site to add my **#RStats** code from the research that I do in physical activity epidemiology. It will provide a platform to showcase my quantitative and programming skill set, but I hope that those just beginning their **#RStats** journey will find my blogs informative and useful for starting to learn R. Check out my favorite R Resources or visit my Blog page to learn more.
