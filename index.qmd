# Welcome!

<h4 style="color:black"> This website was built completely with R (thanks <a href = "https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"> Blogdown! </a>) and HTML </h4>

My name is Brian Helsel and I'm a physical activity epidemiologist and an avid **#RStats** user. I am currently a postdoc with the Division of Physical Activity and Weight Management at the University of Kansas Medical Center. My family and I moved to Kansas City after I completed my PhD at Clemson University in 2020.

My plan is to use this site to add my **#RStats** code from the research that I do in physical activity epidemiology. It will provide a platform to showcase my quantitative and programming skill set, but I hope that those just beginning their **#RStats** journey will find my blogs informative and useful for starting to learn R. Check out my favorite R Resources or visit my Blog page to learn more.
