### About Me

<img alt = 'text' align = 'right' width='200' src=/images/HelselBC.jpg style="padding-left: 10px;"/>

I am currently a postdoc with the Division of Physical Activity and Weight Management at The University of Kansas Medical Center. My educational background is a blend of exercise physiology and public health and my research interests are broadly described as physical activity epidemiology and weight management in individuals with disabilities. I am a husband, father, runner and triathlete, and an avid **#RStats** user who enjoys collaborating on innovative research ideas or open source code. 

*Take a look at some of the work I do and let me know if you are interested in working together on a project!*

### Summary of my research interests

1. Conducting physical activity and weight management interventions in special populations to prevent obesity and other sedentary-related diseases.

2. Improving the validity and reliability of objectively-measured physical activity, dietary intake, and energy expenditure in special populations.

3. Utilizing sensors and technology to capture data that has ecological validity at the behavioral, biological, and physiological level in real-time to inform and adapt interventions.
